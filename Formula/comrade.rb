  # The release CI stamps a stable `url` (the tagged commit) and a bottle block
  # into this formula when it pushes the tap, so `brew install comrade` fetches a
  # prebuilt bottle; libjuice, kcp and libdht get the same treatment, so the
  # whole dependency chain installs as binaries with no build toolchain needed.
  # `head` stays for `brew install --HEAD comrade`, which builds the current tip
  # of main; the build date is taken from the checked-out commit
  # (SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, honoured by the CMake build) so the result is reproducible.
