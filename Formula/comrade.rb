  # The release CI stamps a stable `url` (the tagged commit) and a bottle block
  # into this formula when it pushes the tap, so `brew install comrade` fetches a
  # prebuilt bottle. `head` stays for `brew install --HEAD comrade`, which builds
  # the current tip of main; the build date is taken from the checked-out commit
  # (SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, honoured by the CMake build) so the result is reproducible.
